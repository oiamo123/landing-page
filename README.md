# landing-page
CSS + HTML
Aug 8th 2022,
I decided to pick up on things again roughly ~5 months after I last
fiddled with things. I picked up a little before I left off on 
CSS Foundations through the odin project and completely overhauled my
landing page. I made it so that it is now viewable on mobile. I learned
how to use vw, vh, padding/margin/border percentages and also applied
id's which I overlooked previously.

Going forward, I hope to improve my javascript/css/html intertwinings and plan to also overhaul my rock-paper-scissors which, now that it comes to mind; I dont believe I ever commited to my github portfolio. 

I'm honestly quite proud with how it turned out despite the fact that I couldn't quite determine how to make the page height the portsize height. (If you go to mobile it doesn't cocmpletely fill the screen) which is disapointing however google did not prevail and I determined that spending more time than need be on a minor detail isn't exactly effective time spent.
